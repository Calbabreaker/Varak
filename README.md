# Varak Engine

Varak is a powerful cross-platform engine that can make applications such as games.  

Note: Varak is currently in development and not much is done right now.

## Getting Started

Start by cloning Varak: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Calbabreaker/Varak`.

Make sure to use `--recursive` to clone the submodules. If it wasn't used, then
do `git submodule update --init` to get the submodules.

Then read [BUILDING.md](.github/BUILDING.md) for build instructions.

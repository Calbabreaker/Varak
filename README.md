# Varak

Varak is a powerful cross-platform engine that can make applications such as games.  

Note: Varak is currently in development and not much is done right now.

## Getting Started

Varak currently is only expected to work on visual studio 2019 only. Other tools may not work.

Start by cloning Varak: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Calbabreaker/Varak`.

Make sure it's `--recursive` to clone the submodules. If it wasn't then do `git submodule update --init`

Run the script for your build tool in `scripts/`.

Now build it or open the project file!
